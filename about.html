        <p>
          I am a programmer who is looking to improve his skillset over time.
          I develop projects that interest me and tend to post semi-finished versions on my <a href="https://www.github.com/becauseimgray">Github</a>.
          You will probably notice most of the projects I work on are game related. This is because I have love game programming and find I mostly enjoy visually engaging projects. I also enjoy projects which have to do with algorithms or automation, and putting them into practice.
          My favorite languages are Lua, and Javascript, though I tend to dip my feet into various other languages when I get bored.

          Before programming, I was an AMV Editor for about 4-5 years, starting out in 2007 using Windows Movie Maker and eventually making the switch to Sony Vegas. I uploaded videos I made to Youtube and AnimeMusicVideos.org.
          During this time, I was able to work with various codecs and editors, as well as learning about Avisynth.

          I am a strong advocate for privacy and security as a human right.
