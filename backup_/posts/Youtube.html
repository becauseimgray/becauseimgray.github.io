title: Where is YouTube going?

Anyone who has used YouTube for more than a year has probably gotten to the ups and downs of how poorly the system is handled.
Whether its changing the front page layout over and over, or taking away a highly used feature, such as custom channel pages,
YouTube is pretty well known for not always being on top of what their userbase wants.
With the recent takeover by Google, YouTube has changed even more drastically,
such as switching to Google's Material Design layout, or censoring content based on vague standards.
Now that YouTubers have made their uploads into a career that their life depends on, what will YouTubers do when the site changes become too much?

I think it was in 2010 when channel layouts began to drastically change from custom layouts you could customize
and make your own, to formatted channels with a standard layout.
Many users of the service said they would leave and look to other websites for uploading their content.
YouTube's forums for requesting changes were full to the brim with complaints about how users felt ripped off. YouTube ignored these complaints and continued to make changes to the website.
Even before these problems, the YouTube copyright system was broken(and still is), YouTube's main page is STILL broken, the subscriptions management system is horrid,
 and it is almost impossible to see when someone new has uploaded a video without having to sift through pages upon pages of other content,
 and YouTube's comments are littered with spam and bots.
 Most recently, there was an uproar from both big and small YouTubers after YouTube deleted "inactive" subscribers.
 This was a minor issue for big YouTubers, but as JackSepticEye mentions in a video(), it mostly hurt smaller channels.

 To top it all off, YouTube is one of the companies to have joined the NSA's PRISM program. YouTube is still one of the largest sources of online content and with them running their website this way,
 it makes me wonder if an alternative is due. But what kind of alternative could beat such a large source of media? Users of YouTube have said they would stop using the service before,
 yet YouTube hasn't taken a single dent.

 Here are some alternatives and why I might choose them vs not choose them:

 Vimeo - This site seems to be doing pretty well, but it lacks a few things. While you can upload super high-quality videos to Vimeo,
 their player isn't the greatest, and I don't see a lot of YouTubers making the switch to Vimeo as a first option.
 Despite this, I feel that Vimeo is still a pretty decent alternative to YouTube.

Daily Motion - This site is a lot more like YouTube, but it suffers from a lot of the same problems that YouTube has.

Goblin Media - This is probably the best alternative I've found, but it needs a dedicated website. The biggest issue is how difficult it is for a user to set up and get going.
It is almost the ideal, because if someone could make a dedicated website where users could create an account, which was really just a front-end for a goblin media server which hosts their media,
I think it could be the next big thing. Unfortunately, the project seems fairly dead and difficult for the average user to jump onto.

Unfortunately, despite all these alternatives, I believe that YouTube is here to stay.
With most of the users of YouTube now tied financially to it's success, even if YouTube were to do the most atrocious things,
I doubt YouTubers would be capable of leaving it. At this point, I have one request of you, the reader.
What do YOU think? Should YouTube try to change how it is running its website?
Should YouTubers change to a better alternative?
