It's been a while since I've updated this website, and I think it's time for some changes. I'll be fully reworking the website in the future. 

Here are some of the changes planned:

More links! I want to fully show off what I've been up too and also there are new ways to contact me! Wow! 

More interactions. I want to rework the site, mainly to work on mobile better, but also to show off more animations, fluid movement, etc. 
I want to really get that javascript brewing.
