<p> It's been a while since I've updated this website, and I think it's time for some changes. I'll be fully reworking the website in the future. 
Some of the design plans are to have more links, showing off what I've been working on the past few years and designing new ways to view those links. 
I want the site to be more colorful and have a more game oriented look to it, so it fits me more. 
  
 I'm looking forward to working on the changes and for now I'll be starting with just some concept designs first.
